   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Delta-Notch signaling pathway induces fine-grained patterns of differentiation from initially homogeneous progenitor cells in many biological contexts, including Drosophila bristle formation, where mathematical modeling reportedly suggests the importance of production rate of the components of this signaling pathway. In contrast, the epithelial differentiation of bile ducts in the developing liver is unique in that it occurs around the portal vein cells, which express extremely high amounts of Delta ligands and act as a disturbance for the amount of Delta ligands in the field by affecting the expression levels of downstream target genes in the cells nearby. In the present study, we mathematically examined the dynamics of the Delta-Notch signaling pathway components in disturbance-driven biliary differentiation, using the model for fine-grained patterns of differentiation. RESULTS: A portal vein cell induced a high Notch signal in its neighboring cells, which corresponded to epithelial differentiation, depending on the production rates of Delta ligands and Notch receptors. In addition, this epithelial differentiation tended to occur in conditions where fine-grained patterning was reported to be lacking. These results highlighted the potential importance of the stability towards homogeneity determined by the production rates in Delta ligands and Notch receptors, in a disturbance-dependent epithelial differentiation.},

We set two murine experimental groups in orbit for 35 days aboard the International Space Station, under artificial earth-gravity (artificial 1 g; AG) and microgravity (μg; MG), to investigate whether artificial 1 g exposure prevents muscle atrophy at the molecular level. Our main findings indicated that AG onboard environment prevented changes under microgravity in soleus muscle not only in muscle mass and fiber type composition but also in the alteration of gene expression profiles. In particular, transcriptome analysis suggested that AG condition could prevent the alterations of some atrophy-related genes. We further screened novel candidate genes to reveal the muscle atrophy mechanism from these gene expression profiles. We suggest the potential role of Cacng1 in the atrophy of myotubes using in vitro and in vivo gene transductions. This critical project may accelerate the elucidation of muscle atrophy mechanisms.},

However, current genotyping methods do not allow a comprehensive analysis of diverse mutations for phasing and mosaic variant detection.

Our approach with DAJIN can handle approximately 100 samples under different editing conditions in a single run.

Identified KLF4 L507A mutant accelerated and stabilized reprogramming to pluripotency in both mouse and human somatic cells. By testing all the variants of L507 position, variants with smaller amino acid residues in the KLF4 L507 position showed higher reprogramming efficiency. L507A bound more to promoters or enhancers of pluripotency genes, such as KLF5, and drove gene expression of these genes during reprogramming. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that L507A formed additional interactions with DNA.

Spontaneous remission of FSGS is rare and steroid-resistant FSGS frequently progresses to renal failure. Many inheritable forms of FSGS have been described, caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. Here, we show that a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, MafB, protects against FSGS. MAFB expression was found to be decreased in the podocytes of patients with FSGS. Moreover, conditional podocyte-specific MafB-knockout mice developed FSGS with massive proteinuria accompanied by depletion of the slit diaphragm-related proteins (Nphs1 and Magi2), and the podocyte-specific transcription factor Tcf21. These findings indicate that MafB plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of FSGS. Consistent with this, adriamycin-induced FSGS and attendant proteinuria were ameliorated by MafB overexpression in the podocytes of MafB podocyte-specific transgenic mice. Thus, MafB could be a new therapeutic target for FSGS.},

Various diabetic models, including non-obese diabetic mice and chemically induced diabetic models, are used to characterize and explore the mechanism of the disease’s pathophysiology, in hopes of detecting and identifying novel potential therapeutic targets. However, this is accompanied by disadvantages, such as specific conditions for maintaining the incidence, nonstable hyperglycemia induction, and potential toxicity to other organs. Murine MAFA and MAFB, two closely-linked islet-enriched transcription factors, play fundamental roles in glucose sensing and insulin secretion, and maintenance of pancreatic β-cell, respectively, which are highly homologous to human protein orthologs. Herein, to induce the diabetes mellitus model at a specific time point, we generated Pdx1-dependent Mafb-deletion mice under Mafa knockout condition (A0B∆panc ), via tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP system. After 16 weeks, metabolic phenotypes were characterized by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), urine glucose test, and metabolic parameters analysis. The results indicated that male A0B∆panc mice had obvious impaired glucose tolerance, and high urine glucose level. Furthermore, obvious renal lesions, impaired islet structure and decreased proportion of insulin positive cells were observed. Collectively, our results indicate that A0B∆panc mice can be an efficient inducible model for diabetes research.},

However, only a few models are currently available for glucagon-producing α-cells. Disagreement exists over the role of the MAFB transcription factor in glucagon expression during postnatal life, which might be due to the lack of α-cell-specific Cre driver mice. In the present study, we established a novel Gcg-Cre knock-in mouse line with the Cre transgene expressed under the control of the preproglucagon (Gcg) promoter without disrupting the endogenous Gcg gene expression. Then, we applied this newly developed Gcg-Cre mouse line to generate a new α-cell-specific Mafb conditional knockout mouse model (MafbΔGcg). Not only α-cell number but also glucagon production were significantly decreased in MafbΔGcg mice compared to control littermates, suggesting an indispensable role of MAFB in both α-cell development and function.

Our aim is to identify the novel calcium-binding proteins in testis. The gene EFCAB2 (GenBank NM_026626.3, NP_080902.1) was not previously examined, and its properties and exact mechanisms of action are unknown. In this study, we performed phylogenetic and structure prediction analyses of EFCAB2, which displays definitive structural features. Additionally, the distribution, localization, and calcium binding ability of mouse EFCAB2 were investigated. Results revealed extensive conservation of EFCAB2 among different eukaryotic orthologs. The constructed 3D model predicted that mouse EFCAB2 contains seven α-helices and two EF-hand motifs. The first EF-hand motif is located in N-terminal, while the second is located in C-terminal. By aligning the 3D structure of Ca 2+ -binding loops from EFCAB2 with calmodulin, we predicted six residues that might be involved in Ca 2+ binding. The distribution of the Efcab2 mRNA, as determined by northern blotting, was detected only in the testis among mouse tissues. Native and recombinant EFCAB2 protein were detected by western blotting as one band at 20 kDa. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses showed its localization specifically in spermatogenic cells from primary spermatocytes to elongate spermatids within the seminiferous epithelium, but neither spermatogonia nor somatic cells were expressed. Moreover, EFCAB2 was specifically localized to the principal piece of cauda epididymal sperm flagellum. Furthermore, the analyses of purified recombinant EFCAB2 by Stains-all, ruthenium red staining, and by applying in vitro autoradiography assay showed that the physiological function of this protein is Ca 2+ binding. These results suggested that EFCAB2 might be involved in the control of sperm flagellar movement.

To further analyze the postnatal function of MafB in the pancreas, we generated endocrine cell-specific (Mafb ΔEndo ) and tamoxifen-dependent (Mafb ΔTAM ) Mafb knockout mice. Mafb ΔEndo mice exhibited reduced populations of insulin-positive (insulin + ) and glucagon + cells at postnatal day 0, but the insulin + cell population recovered by 8 weeks of age. In contrast, the Arx + glucagon + cell fraction and glucagon expression remained decreased even in adulthood. Mafb ΔTAM mice, with Mafb deleted after pancreas maturation, also demonstrated diminished glucagon + cells and glucagon content without affecting β cells. A decreased Arx + glucagon + cell population in Mafb ΔEndo mice was compensated for by an increased Arx + pancreatic polypeptide + cell population. Furthermore, gene expression analyses from both Mafb ΔEndo and Mafb ΔTAM islets revealed that MafB is a key regulator of glucagon expression in α cells. Finally, both mutants failed to respond to arginine, likely due to impaired arginine transporter gene expression and glucagon production ability. Taken together, our findings reveal that MafB is critical for the functional maintenance of mouse α cells in vivo, including glucagon production and secretion, as well as in development.},

To clarify the physiological role of core 1-derived O-glycans in macrophages, we exploited the LysM-Cre transgene to generate a conditional Cosmc mutant allele (conditional Cosmc knockout; cKO) in myeloid cells. cKO mice developed normally with no gross phenotypic abnormalities or abnormal peripheral blood counts. Resident peritoneal macrophages (rpMacs) of cKO mice exhibited impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells but showed normal macrophage differentiation and counts. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim4) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor expressed on rpMacs and possesses a heavily O-glycosylated domain. Tim4 tethers apoptotic cells through PS binding. Expression of the Tim4 transcript was unchanged in cKO rpMacs, whereas flow cytometric, Western and dot blot analyses revealed that Tim4 protein expression in cKO rpMacs was significantly lower than that in wild-type (WT) rpMacs. Moreover, the expression levels of other efferocytosis-related molecules, Mertk, Itgav and Itgb3, were normal in rpMacs. In addition, hypoglycosylated Tim4-FLAG fusion protein sufficiently recognized PS. These results demonstrated that core 1-derived O-glycan is required for Tim4-dependent normal efferocytosis and may contribute to the stable expression of the Tim4 glycoprotein.},

   abstract = {Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been attempted for clinical application with diverse iPSCs sources derived from various cell types. This proposes that there would be a shared reprogramming route regardless of different starting cell types. However, the insights of reprogramming process are mostly restricted to only fibroblasts of both human and mouse. To understand molecular mechanisms of cellular reprogramming, the investigation of the conserved reprogramming routes from various cell types is needed. Particularly, the maturation, belonging to the mid phase of reprogramming, was reported as the main roadblock of reprogramming from human dermal fibroblasts to hiPSCs. Therefore, we investigated first whether the shared reprogramming routes exists across various human cell types and second whether the maturation is also a major blockage of reprogramming in various cell types. Results: We selected 3615 genes with dynamic expressions during reprogramming from five human starting cell types by using time-course microarray dataset. Then, we analyzed transcriptomic variances, which were clustered into 3 distinct transcriptomic phases (early, mid and late phase); and greatest difference lied in the late phase. Moreover, functional annotation of gene clusters classified by gene expression patterns showed the mesenchymal-epithelial transition from day 0 to 3, transient upregulation of epidermis related genes from day 7 to 15, and upregulation of pluripotent genes from day 20, which were partially similar to the reprogramming process of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We lastly illustrated variations of transcription factor activity at each time point of the reprogramming process and a major differential transition of transcriptome in between day 15 to 20 regardless of cell types. Therefore, the results implied that the maturation would be a major roadblock across multiple cell types in the human reprogramming process. Conclusions: Human cellular reprogramming process could be traced into three different phases across various cell types. As the late phase exhibited the greatest dissimilarity, the maturation step could be suggested as the common major roadblock during human cellular reprogramming. To understand further molecular mechanisms of the maturation would enhance reprogramming efficiency by overcoming the roadblock during hiPSCs generation.},

   abstract = {Mammalian bodies have more than a billion cells per cubic centimeter, which makes whole-body cell (WBC) profiling of an organism one of the ultimate challenges in biology and medicine. Recent advances in tissue-clearing technology have enabled rapid and comprehensive cellular analyses in whole organs and in the whole body by a combination of state-of-the-art technologies of optical imaging and image informatics. In this review, we focus mainly on the chemical principles in currently available techniques for tissue clearing and staining to facilitate our understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Tissue clearing is usually conducted by the following steps: (a) fixation, (b) permeabilization, (c) decolorizing, and (d) refractive index (RI) matching. To phenotype individual cells after tissue clearing, it is important to visualize genetically encoded fluorescent reporters and or to stain tissues with fluorescent dyes, fluorescent labeled antibodies, or nucleic acid probes. Although some technical challenges remain, the chemical principles in tissue clearing and staining for WBC profiling will enable various applications, such as identifying cellular circuits across multiple organs and measuring their dynamics in stochastic and proliferative cellular processes, for example, autoimmune and malignant neoplastic diseases.},

   abstract = {Here we describe a protocol for advanced CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis). The CUBIC protocol enables simple and efficient organ clearing, rapid imaging by light-sheet microscopy and quantitative imaging analysis of multiple samples. The organ or body is cleared by immersion for 1-14 d, with the exact time required dependent on the sample type and the experimental purposes. A single imaging set can be completed in 30-60 min. Image processing and analysis can take <1 d, but it is dependent on the number of samples in the data set. The CUBIC clearing protocol can process multiple samples simultaneously. We previously used CUBIC to image whole-brain neural activities at single-cell resolution using Arc-dVenus transgenic (Tg) mice. CUBIC informatics calculated the Venus signal subtraction, comparing different brains at a whole-organ scale. These protocols provide a platform for organism-level systems biology by comprehensively detecting cells in a whole organ or body.},

   abstract = {There are few reports on the biological homogeneity within the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) of proton beams. Therefore, to evaluate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER), human salivary gland tumor (HSG) cells were irradiated at the plateau position (position A) and three different positions within a 6-cm-wide SOBP (position B, 26 mm proximal to the middle; position C, middle; position D, 26 mm distal to the middle) using 155-MeV/n proton beams under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions at the Proton Medical Research Center, University of Tsukuba, Japan. The RBE to the plateau region (RBEplateau) and the OER value were calculated from the doses corresponding to 10% survival data. Under the normoxic condition, the RBEplateau was 1.00, 0.99 and 1.09 for positions B, C and D, respectively. Under the hypoxic condition, the RBEplateau was 1.10, 1.06 and 1.12 for positions B, C and D, respectively. The OER was 2.84, 2.60, 2.63 and 2.76 for positions A, B, C and D, respectively. There were no significant differences in either the RBEplateau or the OER between these three positions within the SOBP. In conclusion, biological homogeneity need not necessarily be taken into account for treatment planning for proton beam therapy at the University of Tsukuba.},
